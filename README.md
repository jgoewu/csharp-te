# CSharp TE

Kakou is a text editor developed in C# using WPF as GUI. This project was to help us understand how to connect code from the backend to a GUI frontend, in this case, we had to create a text editor in which we could do simple file I/O on the file we were currently writing, as well as sub windows for an About box and possible other operations that may needed to be done like a font window to change the font or a save/load window which was simply implemented using the built in functions of WPF. This gave us experience working with File I/O, GUI in C# and Event Listening/Triggering.
